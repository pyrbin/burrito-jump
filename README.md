Will you crumble and fail, or are you built to scale? Build your tower, use it to climb and get the burritos ðŸŒ¯

**GMTK Game JAM 2024**

**Theme: Built to Scale**

Goal is to build a tower using blocks from your deck to reach the burrito.
â€‹â€‹
### Building: 

Choose cards & build a tower using "tetris"-like placement. Use A and D to rotate.

### Platforming: 

Control your character using simple 2d platform controls to reach the burrito by "scaling" your tower upwards.

When you reach the burrito you'll get the choice to pick a card to your deck, and discard up to 3. The map will grow higher and you'll have to reach the next burrito.

Your score is calculated by how many cards you used (use less) & how high you got when you eventually fall to your death :)

â€‹Built using Unity.
